# Flood!

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bsm/flood.png)](https://travis-ci.org/bsm/flood)

This is our attempt to open-source several components that are useful for solving common ad-tech development problems. While it's only a small start, we are determined to release more and more packages over time and are looking for active [contributions][CONTRIBUTING.md] from the ad-tech community to help us to create a toolbelt of battle-tested goodies.

## Important Resources

* For more information and guidelines on contributions, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md].
* For licencing, check out our [LICENSE] document.
* API documentation is automatically generated by [GoDoc][godoc].

## Packages

* [health](http://godoc.org/github.com/bsm/flood/health) provides a simple interface and various implementations for common internal health-checks; these can be used to determine an overall 'healthy' system status
* [qfy](http://godoc.org/github.com/bsm/flood/qfy) is an implementation of a production system for qualifying a fact (e.g. an ad request) against a list of pre-defined rule-sets (e.g. targeting criteria) to match a list of suitable candidates; the implemenation is loosely inspired by the [Rete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rete_algorithm) algorithm

## Running tests

Install all dependencies:

```shell
go get -t ./...
