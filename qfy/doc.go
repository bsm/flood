/*
Package qfy is a generic implementation of a semi-optimised qualification rule
evaluation engine, using basic principles or the RETE algorithm.

The goal is to match a fact, usually attributes or key/value pairs against a
list of pre-defined rules. Rules can be simple conditions or complex logical
expressions.
